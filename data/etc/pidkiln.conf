# This works like this. When in heating up (not dwell or cool down) mode and set temperature is 5+C bigger then current temperature (5C because of possible measurement errors)
# PIDKiln will start to count Thermal_Runaway window. If temperature will not go up in this time period for additional +5C, abort.
# Keep in mind that PID algorithm may react slowly - so this value should be quite big (and also depends of your heating element power).
