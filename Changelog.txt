1.4 (2024.03.26)
- fixed/add MAX housing temperature check (was missing in the code)
- added missing q letter in allowed chars for programe name
- extended GMT offset datatype to uint32, to allow more then +/-10h offset

1.3 (2022.01.29) - mostly bugfix release
- fixed more issues created with FS/SPIFFS changes in ESP32 2.0.x framework (graph where missing data, logs and csv where not filled with data)
- fixed grave bug in program subroutine (it had too low priority to work reliable - causing slow updates, and not reliable execution of the program itself)
- fixed MAC address display (was shown in reversed order), add some new chip information to debug screen
- fixed some more possible memory errors in freeing memory
- cleaned/fixed html language and encoding definitions
- add web server simple error handling

1.2 (2021.12.02)
- extended error reporting for MAX31855 and thermocouples
	[ADDONS] Temperature sensor A readout: Internal temp = 26.1 	 Last temp = 24.2 	 Average kiln temp = 20.9
	[ADDONS] ThermocoupleA not connected
	[ADDONS] MAX31855 for ThermocoupleC did not respond
- lowered SPI clock value for less errors during communication handling (in MAX31855 library)
- new feature allowing grace count for errors in MAX31855 readout, from pidkiln.conf:
  # How many thermocouple A and B errors combined, we can tolerate without aborting program.
  # If you have sporadic thermocouple read errors, you can increase this value.
  MAX31855_Error_Grace_Count = 5
- you can now use Wroom modules (without PSRAM) - change MALLOC definition in PIDKiln.ino
- fixed stupid stack overflow in IP display routine
- Updated SPIFFS handling to make it compatible with ESP32 2.0.x+ Arduino framework (it has change silently)

1.1 (2020.03.15)
- synced my local repo with github for MAX31855 library (link in documentation/readme) - there were missing part with linear computation, without it PIDKiln would not compile
- added MAC address information in LCD Info screen (if you would need to add it to your WiFi filtering)
- get rid of awesome font - it required Internet and it's much too heavy for two icons - replaced with PNGs
- replaced index_local.html (with locally provided large JavaScript files for WiFi without Internet) with preference switch - whether to send file locally or remotely (recommended)
- fixed MAX31855 library to detect disconnection
- introduced Syslog feature - to transfer remotely (by UDP) all debug information. You can choose whether you want to have them on serial, syslog or both.
- add 10nF capacitor to thermocouple input pins - it's a must to have reliable readout (I've learned it hard way)
- switched from Adafruit-MAX31855 to enjoyneering/MAX31855 library - much cleaner design

1.0 (2019.10.26)
- implemented basic authentication for WWW interface (add preferences for it) - default username/pw is admin/hotashell
- added PID window divider (as define in PIDKiln.h) - can be use to increase PID responsiveness
- reverse sorting of logs (new = first), add MAX file logs parameter - to erase older logs automatically
- fixes in WiFi mode preferences

0.95 (2019.10.22) Almost, almost there ;)
- add binary firmware flashing with Webpage
- add second SSR for additional heater (works at the same time as SSR1) on GPIO 22 - read explanation in docs
- created new, lazy OTA Installation script for quick installation (I'm not sure if its a good idea but since I could, I've done it ;) )

0.9 (2019.10.12) Almost there
- first release with changelog - all previous releases are only "git commit" documented
- add power meter support
- add AP mode for WiFi (already planed before - just implemented it) - in prefs user can choose between Client mode, AP mode or fail safe mode
- created printable box case for PIDKiln (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3907643)
- add alarm functionality with ALARM_PIN going high on Abort. There is also prefs value - how long keep alarm on.

0.8
- polished web interface
- switch to tasks
- extended safety features
- introduced logs

0.7
- initial fully functional release
